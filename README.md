# What Just Happened
This is a visualization created from a dataset made available by the World Government Summit.

Six different subjects are shown in the dashboard including Health, Energy, Climate, Economy, Education and Life Quality. Years between 2010 and 2020
are shown as a dimension using parallel coordinates. 

The charts are not meant to show trends (since the years are not being used as a continuous measure), but rather to show juxapositions among subject details for the years within a subject. Subject details may include types of renewable energy with the subject of energy for example.

The chart can be seen on Netlify at: https://charming-trifle-6385e1.netlify.app.
